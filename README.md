## What was BigBot?

BigBot was a Discord bot designed by [@FirestarAD](https://github.com/FirestarAD), [@lightninq720](https://github.com/lightninq720), [@heroescreed](https://github.com/heroescreed). It served as a general purpose bot reaching 600+ servers and over 113,411 users.

Unfortunately due to a database failure and high running costs the Nom Industries team decided to let BigBot go and move onto other projects.
